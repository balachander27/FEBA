# FEBA
FEature Based Analyzer(FEBA) consists of 2 algorithms. One being HAT (Histogram Augmentation Technique) and other is FIC (Feature Importance Classifer). HAT makes use of the feeature's histogram to augment/ balance the existing tabular dataset. FIC makes use of chi-square to rank the feature and employs ensemble learning to classify a given tabular data.

HAT_example and FIC_example notebooks gives an idea on how to use these algorithms.
